# Fate Sealed: GMTK Game Jam 2025

**This year's game jam theme is:** **Loop**!

Made within 48 hours, _Fate Sealed_ is a puzzle-platformer inspired by games like _Braid_ and _Outer Wilds_, where the player can utilize fated time loops to dodge enemies and reach the portal.

> _The world of **Fate Sealed** is full of deadly enemies that will hunt you down in an instant, and unfortunately you left your fists at home. But, using your ability to seal the fate of enemies around you, you can sneakily dodge their attacks, predict their movements, and even pit them against each other to progress through the levels._
